# Gatsby Aircraft

###  I'm learning [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and hate todo apps.

> Airplanes are much nicer, don't you think?

This is a Gatsby.js Project in which I utilize `gatsby-transformer-json` and `gatsby-transformer-remark` to better familiarize myself with the manner in which Gatsby implements GraphQL.

### To Run:

```bash

npm i -S

# development
gatsby develop

# produciton build
gatsby build

```
