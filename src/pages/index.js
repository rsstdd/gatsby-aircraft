      During World War II, aviation became a critical component of modern
      warfare. Aircraft played a crucial role throughout the entire war, from
      the Battle of Britain in the early stages to the great aircraft carrier
      battles between American and Japanese Pacific fleets. The major combatants
      manufactured huge air forces that engaged in pitched battles in the air
      and on the ground. Bombing established itself as a major strategic force,
      and this was also the first war in which the aircraft carrier played a
      significant role.
